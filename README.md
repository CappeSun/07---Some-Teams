# 07 - Some-Teams

This is the first of many assignments for my education at YRGO, called "Some Teams".

The purpose of this project (aside from me passing) is to turn data from an array into a presentable format. The project is split into a number of files, each taking care of one part of displaying the page.

The data.php file contains an array of football teams and various data about them.

The head.php file contains the head part of the page.

The teamsCount.php file prints the number of different teams present in the array.

The tablePrint.php file prints a table of all teams and their properties defined in data.php.

The citiesPrint.php file prints all unique cities included in data.php.
